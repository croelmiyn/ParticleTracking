This is a suite of ImageJ plugins for performing 2D particle tracking.

- Point.java
- Traj.java
- MovieNormalizer_.java
- Particle_Tracker.java
- Particle_Tracker_totInt.java
- Trajectory_Linker.java
- PartTracker_TrajectorySorterInt.java

**File descriptions:**

_Utility files:_ 
- Point.java: Class for storing coordinates of Each Points
- Traj.java: Class for storing Points classified as belonging to the same trajectories 

_Preprocessing (optional):_
- MovieNormalizer_.java: Computes the time average of the movie (mean image) and normalizes each frame by dividing by the mean image

_Processing: _
- Particle_Tracker.java: group above threshold pixels in Points, computes their position by the intensity weighted centroid method and outputs spatiotemporal position and the size (nb of pixels) of each points

- Particle_Tracker_totInt.java: Same as Particle_Tracker but: 
    1. the position of each Point is computed as the average position of the pixels (no intensity weighted centroid)  
    2. the mean intensity of each Point is an output
                              
- Trajectory_Linker.java: connects points into a trajectory following a minimal proximity in the next frame algorithm 

_PostProcessing:_
- PartTracker_TrajectorySorterInt.java: selects trajectories longer than a user defined threshold and saves them as text file

**Instructions:**

_Preparation:_
- Upload the ParticleTracking folder in the IJ Plugin directory
- Get jtransforms-2.4.jar from croelmiyn/FourierImageAnalysis/packages and upload to Plugin directory

_Execution:_

1. MovieNormalizer_ : runs without user inputs

2. Particle_Tracker (or Particle_Tracker_totInt):
- Open movie in ImageJ and decide on a threshold if relevant
- Execute: GUI interface pops up

    Parameters:
    - min_particle_radius: minimum radius a group of pixel needs to have to be considered a trackable point 
    - separate: if checked, particles with multiple maxima will be split in several particles, using a Gaussian fit of their intensity profiles
    - Method for threshold: method for separating Points from background
    - CutOff: _cutOff_ parameter for the method

        pixel counts as Point if:
        -  cutoff_above_background: intensity > median(pixels) + _cutOff_ * standardDeviation(pixels), 
        -  threshold: intensity > _cutOff_
        -  percentile: intensity in the _cutOff_ brighter pixel fraction
        -  AbsThresh_above_bgd: intensity > mean(pixels_in_given_frame) + _cutOff_
 
- Output is a Result_Table containing the detected Points in each frame, which needs to be saved (PartTracked_).

3. Trajectory_Linker
- If FIJI: open the PartTracked_ as a ResultTable (File>Import>Results...)
- Run parameters:
      - Maximum Distance: maximum distance a particle is allowed to travel between 2 frames
      - print: if checked, the trajectories and cell positions will be displayed on the movie stack

4. PartTracker_TrajectorySorterInt: minimum_trajectory_length: minimum duration of a trajectory to be selected.
